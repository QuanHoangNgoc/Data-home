# üöÄ **GPU-Powered Object Detection and Classification with YOLOv8 and TensorFlow-Keras**

## üåü What is it?

This project leverages the power of GPUs and state-of-the-art deep learning models for object detection and classification. It includes scripts for setting up a training environment using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and TensorFlow for building a custom classification network. The repository offers a complete pipeline, from data preparation to training, evaluation, and deployment of object detection and classification models.

## üéØ Why did we do it?

Our goal was to create a comprehensive example demonstrating:
- **Efficient Object Detection:** Using YOLO to quickly and accurately detect objects in images.
- **Custom Image Classification:** Building a custom image classification model using TensorFlow-Keras and MobileNetV2.
- **Leveraging GPU Acceleration:** Ensuring all operations run smoothly on a GPU to save time and increase performance.
